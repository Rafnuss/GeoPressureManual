# Introduction {-}

<img src="assets/cover.png" class="cover" width="250" height="328"/>Determining the positions, and over time trajectories, of wildlife is crucial to apprehend ecological relationships in nature. Since satellite devices (e.g. GPS) are too heavy for most bird species, lightweight geolocators remain an essential tool for ecologists. 

Geolocation by pressure provides a new and exciting opportunity to determine the position of tracked birds with high precision. As atmospheric pressure varies in space and time, a timeseries of pressure measurement recorded at a single location constitutes a unique signature which can be used for global positioning. 

The method has been published in the following two papers: @Nussbaumer2023a presents the method to estimate a map of likely positions from a pressure timeseries, and @Nussbaumer2023b describes a new approach to reconstruct the full trajectory of a bird quickly and accurately, using pressure and wind data. 

The GeoPressure suite helps users tackle the challenges of geolocation by pressure and provides a toolkit to implement both these methods. For a quick overview of the method, here is a 10 min presentation:

## Data requirements

The only requirement is that your geolocator provides a continuous timeseries of pressure (<1hr resolution). Beyond this, here are a few things that can help: 

- GeoPressureR works best for species with a clear separation between stationary and migratory periods, as opposed to birds moving continuously over time and/or gradually over large distances (10-50km) or altitude (>10m). As such, aerial feeders such as swifts or bee-eaters or mountainous species do not lend themselves well to this method. 
- Acceleration data can be helpful to define the periods of flight, especially if your bird flies at low altitude or if pressure data is measured on a coarse temporal resolution (>15min). 
- Light data can accelerate building the trajectory model by allowing to quickly narrow down possible locations during short stationary periods.
- Knowing the equipment and retrieval sites can also be helpful. 

GeoPressureR can currently read Swiss Ornithological Institute files (`*.pressure`, `*.lux`, `*.acceleration`) and Migrate Technology files (`pressure_file = "*.deg"` and `light_file = "*.lux"`).

## The GeoPressure suite

The GeoPressure suite includes several tools: 

- [GeoPressureR](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureR) is the main R package with functions to run the analysis.
- [GeoPressureManual]() is the official user guide developed to help you learn to use GeoPressureR.
- [GeoPressureTemplate](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureTemplate) is a [template Github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to help kickstart your project.
- [GeoPressureAPI](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureAPI) is the JSON API used by GeoPressureR under the hood to query the ERA5 reanalysis data with Google Earth Engine.
- GeoPressureViz is a [shiny app] included in GeoPressureR to visualize the trajectory of your bird. See the [GeoPressureViz] chapter for an introduction and [the demo for 18LX](https://rafnuss.shinyapps.io/GeoPressureViz/).

## Structure of the manual

This manual provides an easy entry point into pressure positioning. It includes three parts: 

- [Basic tutorial] runs through the entire workflow using a simple track of pressure only, with the example of a Swainson's Warbler.
- [Advanced tutorial] explores additional functionalities of the package using light, acceleration, and wind data, through the example of a Great Reed Warbler.
- [Labeling tools] introduces labeling, a critical step in the workflow. Although it is briefly mentioned in the first two tutorials, this complex procedure requires a comprehensive understanding of the method and tools of the package, which is why it is described in more depth here. We strongly recommended reading this section attentively for optimal results.

Feel free to simply go through the manual, or to [clone the repository]() to run the examples at your own pace.

## Code structure

[GeoPressureTemplate](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureTemplate#project-structure-file_folder) defines a standard folder structure to improve readability, sharability, and reproducibility. The structure follows the standard recommendation of separating `data` and `analysis` (see [Cookiecutter Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) , [rrrpkg](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg) or [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) for the rationale behind this). 

The code and manual follow this same standard directory and file name.

## Installation

You can install the GeoPressureR package through Github: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rafnuss/GeoPressureR")
```

You can then load it, as well as a few others that we will need later:

```{r, setup, message = FALSE}
library(GeoPressureR)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(terra)
library(knitr)
```
