   abstract = {Bayesian sequential simulation (BSS) is a geostastistical technique, which uses a secondary variable to guide the stochastic simulation of a primary variable. As such, BSS has proven significant promise for the integration of disparate hydrogeophysical data sets characterized by vastly differing spatial coverage and resolution of the primary and secondary variables. An inherent limitation of BSS is its tendency to underestimate the variance of the simulated fields due to the smooth nature of the secondary variable. Indeed, in its classical form, the method is unable to account for this smoothness because it assumes independence of the secondary variable with regard to neighbouring values of the primary variable. To overcome this limitation, we have modified the Bayesian updating with a log-linear pooling approach, which allows us to account for the inherent interdependence between the primary and the secondary variables by adding exponential weights to the corresponding probabilities. The proposed method is tested on a pertinent synthetic hydrogeophysical data set consisting of surface-based electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data and local borehole measurements of the hydraulic conductivity. Our results show that, compared to classical BSS, the proposed log-linear pooling method using equal constant weights for the primary and secondary variables enhances the reproduction of the spatial statistics of the stochastic realizations, while maintaining a faithful correspondence with the geophysical data. Significant additional improvements can be achieved by optimizing the choice of these constant weights. We also explore a dynamic adaptation of the weights during the course of the simulation process, which provides valuable insights into the optimal parametrization of the proposed log-linear pooling approach. The results corroborate the strategy of selectively emphasizing the probabilities of the secondary and primary variables at the very beginning and for the remainder of the simulation process, respectively.},

   abstract = {Light-level geolocator tags use ambient light recordings to estimate the whereabouts of an individual over the time it carried the device. Over the past decade, these tags have emerged as an important tool and have been used extensively for tracking animal migrations, most commonly small birds. Analysing geolocator data can be daunting to new and experienced scientists alike. Over the past decades, several methods with fundamental differences in the analytical approach have been developed to cope with the various caveats and the often complicated data. Here, we explain the concepts behind the analyses of geolocator data and provide a practical guide for the common steps encompassing most analyses – annotation of twilights, calibration, estimating and refining locations, and extraction of movement patterns – describing good practices and common pitfalls for each step. We discuss criteria for deciding whether or not geolocators can answer proposed research questions, provide guidance in choosing an appropriate analysis method and introduce key features of the newest open-source analysis tools. We provide advice for how to interpret and report results, highlighting parameters that should be reported in publications and included in data archiving. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive supplementary online manual that applies the concepts to several datasets, demonstrates the use of open-source analysis tools with step-by-step instructions and code and details our recommendations for interpreting, reporting and archiving.},

   abstract = {Background: Over the past decade, the miniaturisation of animal borne tags such as geolocators and GPS-transmitters has revolutionized our knowledge of the whereabouts of migratory species. Novel light-weight multi-sensor loggers (1.4g), which harbour sensors for measuring ambient light intensity, atmospheric pressure, temperature and acceleration, were fixed to two long-distance migrant bird species - eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops) and great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Using acceleration and atmospheric pressure data recorded every 5 and 30min, respectively, we aimed at reconstructing individual diurnal and seasonal patterns of flight activity and flight altitude and thereby, at describing basic, yet hitherto unknown characteristics of migratory flight behaviour. Furthermore, we wanted to characterise the variability in these migration characteristics between individuals, species and migration periods. Results: The flight duration from breeding to sub-Saharan African non-breeding sites and back was more variable within than between the species. Great reed warblers were airborne for a total of 252 flight hours and thus, only slightly longer than eurasian hoopoes with 232h. With a few exceptions, both species migrated predominantly nocturnally - departure around dusk and landing before dawn. Mean flight altitudes were higher during pre- than during post-breeding migration (median 1100 to 1600ma.s.l.) and flight above 3000m occurred regularly with a few great reed warblers exceeding 6000ma.s.l. (max. 6458ma.s.l.). Individuals changed flight altitudes repeatedly during a flight bout, indicating a continuous search for (more) favourable flight conditions. Conclusions: We found high variation between individuals in the flight behaviour parameters measured - a variation that surprisingly even exceeded the variation between the species. More importantly, our results have shown that multi-sensor loggers have the potential to provide detailed insights into many fundamental aspects of individual behaviour in small aerial migrants. Combining the data recorded on the multiple sensors with, e.g., remote sensing data like weather and habitat quality on the spatial and temporal scale will be a great step forward to explore individual decisions during migration and their consequences.},

   abstract = {A new analysis of twilight predicts that for observations made in narrow-band blue light, the shape of the light curve (irradiance vs. sun elevation angle) between +3 and –5° (87 to 95° zenith angle) has a particular rigid shape not significantly affected by cloudi- ness, horizon details, atmospheric refraction or atmospheric dust loading. This shape is dis- tinctive, can be located reliably in measured data, and provides a firm theoretical basis for animal geolocation by template-fitting to irradiance data. The resulting approach matches a theoretical model of the irradiance vs. time-of-day to the relevant portion of a given day’s data, adjusting parameters for latitude, longitude, and cloudiness. In favorable cases, there is only one parameter choice that will fit well, and that choice becomes the position estimate. The entire process can proceed automatically in a tag. Theoretical estimates predict good accuracy over most of the year and most of the earth, with difficulties just on the winter side of equinox and near the equator. Polar regions are favorable whenever the sun crosses –5° to +3° elevation, and the method can yield useful results whenever the sun makes a significant excursion into that elevation range. Early results based on data taken on land at 48°N latitude confirm the predictions vs. season, and show promising},

   abstract = {The need for combining different sources of information in a probabilistic framework is a frequent task in earth sciences. This is a need that can be seen when modeling a reservoir using direct geological observations, geophysics, remote sensing, training images, and more. The probability of occurrence of a certain lithofacies at a certain location for example can easily be computed conditionally on the values observed at each source of information. The problem of aggregating these different conditional probability distributions into a single conditional distribution arises as an approximation to the inaccessible genuine conditional probability given all information. This paper makes a formal review of most aggregation methods proposed so far in the literature with a particular focus on their mathematical properties. Exact relationships relating the different methods is emphasized. The case of events with more than two possible outcomes, never explicitly studied in the literature, is treated in detail. It is shown that in this case, equivalence between different aggregation formulas is lost. The concepts of calibration, sharpness, and reliability, well known in the weather forecasting community for assessing the goodness-of-fit of the aggregation formulas, and a maximum likelihood estimation of the aggregation parameters are introduced. We then prove that parameters of calibrated log-linear pooling formulas are a solution of the maximum likelihood estimation equations. These results are illustrated on simulations from two common stochastic models for earth science: the truncated Gaussian model and the Boolean. It is found that the log-linear pooling provides the best prediction while the linear pooling provides the worst.},
