# Pressure map

This chapter covers the main steps to determine the position of a bird from pressure data. This code basically implement the method presented in @Nussbaumer2022a.

## Read geolocator data

We read the geolocator data and crop it so that it starts on the equipment date and ends on the retrieval date.

```{r}
pam <- pam_read(
  pathname = "data/0_PAM/18LX",
  crop_start = "2017-06-20",
  crop_end = "2018-05-02"
)
```

`pam_read()` currently support data from Swiss Ornithological Institute files (`*.pressure`, `*.lux`, `*.acceleration`) and Migrate Technology (`.deg`, `*.lux`). For other file format, please contact me ([submit a Github issue](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureR/issues/new) or [email](mailto:rafnuss@gmail.com)).

## Label tracks

To ensure the high level of precision needed for the pressure match, we must manually edit the activity classification and  the pressure time series to be matched. We suggest doing this with TRAINSET. [labelling tracks] is dedicated to this exercise and includes tips and best practices. Here, we will just walk through the main step of the workflow.

### Automatic classification of activity

We initialize the labelling file with an automatic classification of activity. We first use a [k-mean clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to group periods of low and high activity and then classify high activities lasting more than 30 minutes as migratory activities. See more possible classifications in the [PALMr manual](https://kiranlda.github.io/PAMLrManual/index.html).

```{r, results='hide'}
pam <- pam_classify(pam, min_duration = 30)
```

If your track has only pressure data and no acceleration data, see [this gitub issue](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureR/discussions/26).

### Edit activity on TRAINSET
Use `trainset_write()` to export the automatically generated classifications in a `csv` file, which can be opened in TRAINSET: [https://trainset.geocene.com/](https://trainset.geocene.com/).

```{r}
trainset_write(pam, pathname = "data/1_pressure/labels/")
# browseURL("https://trainset.geocene.com/")
```


![*Print screen of the manual classification in TRAINSET. See [labelling tracks] for more information.*](assets/labelling-tracks-0.png){width=100%}

When you have finished the manual editing, export the new `csv` file (TRAINSET will add `-labeled` in the name) in `/data/1_pressure/labels/`) and read this file with `trainset_read()`.

```{r}
pam <- trainset_read(pam, pathname = "data/1_pressure/labels/")
```

## Identify stationary periods {#identify-stationary-periods}

Based on the activity labelling, `pam_sta()` creates a table of stationary periods as illustrated below.

```{r}
pam <- pam_sta(pam)
knitr::kable(head(pam$sta))
```

We can visualize the pressure measurements for each grouped stationary period (symbolized by a different color). The back dots represents the pressure labeled as outlier and these data-point will not be matched.

```{r}
pressure_na <- pam$pressure
pressure_na$obs[pressure_na$isoutlier | pressure_na$sta_id == 0] <- NA
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = pam$pressure, aes(x = date, y = obs), col = "grey") +
  geom_line(data = pressure_na, aes(x = date, y = obs, col = as.factor(sta_id))) +
  geom_point(data = subset(pam$pressure, isoutlier), aes(x = date, y = obs), colour = "black") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Pressure (hPa)") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = rep(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, "Set1"), times = 8))

ggplotly(p, dynamicTicks = T) %>%
  layout(
    showlegend = F,
    legend = list(orientation = "h", x = -0.5),
    yaxis = list(title = "Pressure [hPa]")
  )
```

## Compute pressure maps
Now that we have clean pressure time series for each stationary period, we are ready to match each one with a weather reanalysis dataset (ERA5). To overcome the challenge of handling such a large dataset, GeoPressureR uses the [API GeoPressure](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureAPI) to perform the computation on Google Earth Engine.

Initially, it is easier and faster to query only long stationary periods (in the example below, we select only periods longer than 12hrs). You can do so by setting the pressure of the stationary periods you wish to discard to `NA`.

```{r}
sta_id_keep <- pam$sta$sta_id[difftime(pam$sta$end, pam$sta$start, units = "hours") > 0]
pam$pressure$sta_id[!(pam$pressure$sta_id %in% sta_id_keep)] <- NA
```

We can now query the data on the API with `geopressure_map()`. A detailed description of the parameters can be found [here](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureAPI/#request). This will take a couple of minutes to run.

```{r, cache=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
pressure_maps <- geopressure_map(
  pam$pressure,
  extent = c(50, -16, 0, 23), # coordinates of the map to request (N, W, S, E)
  scale = 2, # request on a 1/2=0.5Â° grid to make the code faster
  max_sample = 250, # limit the query to the first 250 data-points.
  margin = 30 # roughly equivalent to 3hPa
)
```

`geopressure_map()` returns a list of two rasters for each stationary periods. The first is the mean square error ($\textbf{MSE}$) between the pressure time series and ERA5 map. The second ($\textbf{z}_{thr}$) is the proportion of data-points in the pressure time series which correspond to an altitude that falls between the min and max altitude of each grid cell. Read more about these values and how they are computed [here](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureAPI/#description).

## Compute probability maps

We then combine the two rasters in a single probability map using
$$\textbf{P} = \exp \left(-w \frac{\textbf{MSE}}{s} \right) [\textbf{z}_{thr}>thr]$$
where $s$ is the standard deviation of pressure and $thr$ is the threshold mask. Because the auto-correlation of the time series is not accounted for in this equation, we use a log-linear pooling weight $w=\log(n) - 1$, where $n$ is the number of data-points in the time series. [Probability aggregation] describing the influence of log-linear pooling and length of time series will be added later. 

```{r}
pressure_prob <- geopressure_prob_map(
  pressure_maps,
  s = 1, # standard deviation of pressure
  thr = 0.9 # threshold of the threshold proportion value acceptable
)
```

We use [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to visualize the threshold mask, mismatch map, and overall probability map for a single stationary period.

```{r, warning=F}
i_r <- 2
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TerrainBackground) %>%
  addFullscreenControl() %>%
  addRasterImage(pressure_prob[[i_r]], opacity = 0.8, colors = "OrRd", group = "Probability") %>%
  addRasterImage(pressure_maps[[i_r]][[1]], opacity = 0.8, colors = "OrRd", group = "Mismatch") %>%
  addRasterImage(pressure_maps[[i_r]][[2]], opacity = 0.8, colors = "OrRd", group = "Threashold") %>%
  # addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(v[[i_s]][[3]]), title = "Probability") %>%
  addLayersControl(
    overlayGroups = c("Probability", "Mismatch", "Threashold"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  ) %>%
  hideGroup(c("Mismatch", "Threashold"))
```

We can also visualize the probability map for all stationary periods:

```{r}
li_s <- list()
l <- leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TerrainBackground) %>%
  addFullscreenControl()
for (i_r in seq_len(length(pressure_prob))) {
  i_s <- metadata(pressure_prob[[i_r]])$sta_id
  info <- pam$sta[pam$sta$sta_id == i_s, ]
  info_str <- paste0(i_s, " | ", format(info$start, "%d-%b %H:%M"), "->", format(info$end, "%d-%b %H:%M"))
  li_s <- append(li_s, info_str)
  l <- l %>% addRasterImage(pressure_prob[[i_r]], opacity = 0.8, colors = "OrRd", group = info_str)
}
l %>%
  addLayersControl(
    overlayGroups = li_s,
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  ) %>%
  hideGroup(tail(li_s, length(li_s) - 1))
```


## Compute altitude

The second operation you can perform with GeoPressureR is to compute the exact altitude of the bird $z_{gl}$ from its pressure measurement $P_{gl}$ using the barometric equation, correcting for the natural variation of pressure and temperature.


This function used is
$$ z_{gl}(x)=z_{ERA5}(x) + \frac{T_{ERA5}(x)}{L_b}  \left( \frac{P_{gl}}{P_{ERA5}(x)} \right) ^{\frac{RL_b}{g M}-1},$$
where $z_{ERA}$, $T_{ERA}$ and $P_{ERA}$  respectively correspond to the ground level elevation, temperature at 2m and ground level pressure of ERA5, $L_b$  is the standard temperature lapse rate, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $g$ is the gravity constant and  $M$ is the molar mass of air. See more information [here](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureAPI/#description-1).

To illustrate the benefit of using this equation, we will compute the bird's altitude for its first stationary period using (1) GeoPressureR and (2) the barometric equation using standard atmosphere condition.

We first determine the position of the bird by using the most likely position using `geopressure_map2path`
```{r}
pt <- geopressure_map2path(pressure_prob[1])
```

And then call the function `geopressure_ts()` with the subset of pressure containing `sta_id==1`

```{r, cache=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
pressure_timeserie_1 <- geopressure_ts(pt$lon, pt$lat, pressure = subset(pam$pressure, sta_id == 1))
```

We can compare the altitude produced to the one computed without the correction for temperature and pressure:

```{r}
Lb <- -0.0065
R <- 8.31432
g0 <- 9.80665
M <- 0.0289644
T0 <- 273.15 + 15
P0 <- 1013.25
pressure_timeserie_1$altitude_baro <- T0 / Lb * ((pressure_timeserie_1$pressure / P0)^(-R * Lb / g0 / M) - 1)
```

and visualize this comparison:

```{r}
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = as.data.frame(pressure_timeserie_1), aes(x = date, y = altitude, col = as.factor("Corrected elevation with ERA5"))) +
  geom_line(data = as.data.frame(pressure_timeserie_1), aes(x = date, y = altitude_baro, col = as.factor("Uncorrected elevation"))) +
  labs(col = "") +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(p) %>%
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", x = -0.5))
```

The function `geopressure_ts()` also returns the ground level pressure time series from ERA5 at the location specified. This is useful to check whether there is a good match between the pressure measured by the geolocator and the one at the assumed location. This operation is typically used to check the quality of the manual labelling (see [labelling tracks]).

## Compute pressure and altitude for the path

We can repeat the computation of the pressure time series for all stationary periods. First we compute all the most likely position from the probability map of pressure. 

```{r}
path <- geopressure_map2path(pressure_prob)
```
 
Secondly, we can use `geopressure_ts_path()` which basically call `geopressure_ts()` in parallel for all stationary periods. We can additionally request to compute the altitude during the next flight flight with `include_flight = c(0,1)`. Note that if a position of the path is over water, it will be moved to the closest point onshore.

```{r, cache=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=F}
pressure_timeserie <- geopressure_ts_path(path, pam$pressure, include_flight = c(0, 1))
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = do.call("rbind", pressure_timeserie), aes(x = date, y = altitude)) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Altitude (m)")
ggplotly(p, dynamicTicks = T) %>% layout(showlegend = F)
```



```{r}
col <- rep(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, "Set1"), times = ceiling((nrow(pam$sta) + 1) / 9))
col <- col[1:(nrow(pam$sta) + 1)]
names(col) <- levels(factor(c(0, pam$sta$sta_id)))

p <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = pam$pressure, aes(x = date, y = obs), colour = "grey") +
  geom_point(data = subset(pam$pressure, isoutlier), aes(x = date, y = obs), colour = "black") +
  # geom_line(data = pressure_na, aes(x = date, y = obs, color = factor(sta_id))) +
  geom_line(data = subset(do.call("rbind", pressure_timeserie), sta_id != 0), aes(x = date, y = pressure0, col = factor(sta_id))) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = col) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Pressure (hPa)")

ggplotly(p, dynamicTicks = T) %>% layout(showlegend = F)
```


## Save
```{r}
save(
  pressure_timeserie,
  pressure_prob,
  pam,
  file = "data/1_pressure/18LX_pressure_prob.Rdata"
)
```
