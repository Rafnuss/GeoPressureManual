# Export and Visual

In this extra chapter we will see how to create some additional figure and export the data

Let's try to create some of the amazing visual trajectory from [MoveVis](https://movevis.org/index.html)

We'll need the `tag` structure to know the time and a path (lat, lon) which can come from any previously computed ones (simulations, shortes path, etc). Here we'll use the shortest path from the wind graph result

```{r}
load("data/1_pressure/18LX_pressure_prob.Rdata")
load("data/5_wind_graph/18LX_wind_graph.Rdata")
path <- shortest_path
```

Because the path encode the position during the entire stationary period, we need to produce a data.frame with the position at the start and end of each stationary period (i.e., thebird did not moved in between). We can do this with this function.

```{r}
df <- path2df(tag, path)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
frames <- df2move(df, CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84"),
             x = "lon", y = "lat", time = "time", track_id = "track_id") |> 
  align_move(res = 24, unit = "hours", digit = 12) |>  # Use midday position rather than midnight (while the bird could be flying)
  subset_move(from = tag$sta$end[1]-3*60*60*24, to = tail(tag$sta$start, 1)+0*60*60*24) |> # remove the long equipement and retrival period duration
  frames_spatial(equidistant = T, 
                 ext = extent(static_prob[[1]])) |> # 
  add_labels(x = NULL, y = NULL) |> # add some customizations, such as axis labels
  add_timestamps(type = "label", size = 6) |>
  add_progress()
```

It is worth checking what a frame looks like before generating the entire gif (taking around 10 min) with `frames[[100]]`. If you're satisfy, then, go for it!

```{r, eval=F}
animate_frames(frames, out_file = paste0("assets/movevis_18LX.gif"), height = 1000, width = 1000, overwrite = T)
```

And here is the map! Check out [moveVis examples for more idea](https://movevis.org/index.html#examples)
